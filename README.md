## üìò How Does It Work?

- When you run the program, a new non-resizable window will open.  
- The application provides three main functionalities:  
  1. Add a new website-password entry.
  2. Search for an existing website-password entry.  
  3. Generate a secure random password.  
- The `Email/Username` input field is pre-filled with a random example, but you can modify it.

   - `Email/Username`: Provide the email or username you use for the website.  
   - `Password`: Type the password you use for the website.  
     - *Note: The password is visible to avoid typing errors.*  

2. **Save the Entry:**  
   - After filling all inputs, click the **"Add"** button.

3. Once saved, all inputs will be cleared for the next entry or set back to the default values.  

### Search for a Website-Password

To retrieve saved credentials:  
1. Enter the website name in the `Website` input field.  
2. Click the **"Search"** button:  
   - If the website is found, the saved email/username and password will be displayed.

### Generate a Secure Password  

To generate a random password:  
1. Click the **"Generate Password"** button.  
2. A new password will appear in the `Password` input field.  
   - Generated passwords will always follow this pattern:  
     - 8 letters, 4 numbers, and 4 special characters.

### Saving the Information 

- All added entries are stored in a file named `passwords.json`.  
- This file is created in the same directory as the program.  
- The file is in JSON format, making it easy to read or manually edit if necessary.  
- Example of the JSON structure:

## üí° Notes

- Ensure Python and the necessary libraries are properly installed.  
- The program is intended for personal use only and easier password management.  
- Always keep your `passwords.json` file in a secure location, because the program does not offer any actual security.
